To-Do List App - README
This is a simple web-based to-do list application built using:
* JavaScript: for application logic and interactivity
* HTML: for defining the structure of the web page
* CSS: for styling the user interface
Features:
* Add new tasks with descriptions and optional due dates.
* Mark completed tasks by checking them off.
* Delete unwanted tasks.
Running the application:
1. Save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the same directory.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
How to use:
1. Enter your task description in the input field.
2. (Optional) Select a due date using the date picker.
3. Click the "Add Task" button.
4. To mark a task as complete, click the checkbox next to it.
5. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to it.
Note:
* This application does not currently save data persistently. Refreshing the page will clear your tasks.
Further development:
This is a basic example, and you can continue to develop it further by:
* Implementing local storage to save tasks across sessions.
* Adding features like task categories or priorities.
* Implementing a user interface framework for a more polished look and feel.
Feel free to explore and customize the code to fit your needs!
